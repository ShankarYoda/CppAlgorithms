Excited ⁉️ 🤩 🤩 🤩
To add your contributions towards opensource community and grab the oppurtunity😃 😃😃

Then lets start with this repository.

Head down ⬇️ ⬇️ ⬇️ to see how to get started with the repo and follow the guidelines 🎯 🎯 🎯
⚠️Rules ❕ ❕ 😼 😼 😼:
✅ Pull requests can be submitted to any opted-in repository on GitHub or GitLab.

✅ The pull request must contain commits you made yourself.

✅ If a maintainer reports your pull request as 'spam' or 'invalid', it will not be counted toward your participation in Hacktoberfest.

✅ If a maintainer reports behaviour that’s not in line with the project’s code of conduct, you will be ineligible to participate.

✅ To get a shirt, you must make four approved pull requests (PRs) on opted-in projects between October 1-31 in any time zone. This year, the first 55,000 participants can earn a T-shirt.

⚠️What not to do ❗ ❗ 😤 😤
❌ PRs that are automated (e.g. scripted opening PRs to remove whitespace/optimize images)

❌ PRs that are disruptive (e.g. taking someone else’s branch/commits and making a PR)

❌ PRs that are regarded by a project maintainer as a hindrance vs. helping

❌ Something that’s clearly an attempt to simply +1 your PR count for October
